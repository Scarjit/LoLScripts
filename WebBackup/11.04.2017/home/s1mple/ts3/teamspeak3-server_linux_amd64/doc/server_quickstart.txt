TeamSpeak 3 Server - Quickstart Guide

=====================================================
Copyright (c) TeamSpeak Systems GmbH



-----------------------------------------------------------
1. System requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Windows
Windows XP, 2003, 2003 R2, 2008, Vista, 7, 2008 R2, 8 and 2012. Both 32bit and 64bit are natively
supported.

2. Linux
A reasonably modern Linux environment with libstdc++ 6 is required. Both 32bit and 64bit are
natively supported. In addition, TeamSpeak 3 requires the epoll API which was introduced in Linux
kernel 2.5.44. Support was added to glibc in version 2.3.2.

3. Mac OS X
Mac OS X 10.3.9 or better on Macs with Intel processors. Note that PowerPC processors are no longer
supported.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Windows
Download the correct file for your architecture:
 - teamspeak3-server_win32.zip for 32bit Windows
 - teamspeak3-server_win64.zip for 64bit Windows

We recommend running the TeamSpeak 3 Server from the command shell. Extract the archive in a
directory of your choice. Open the command shell and change path to this directory. From here you
can start the server executable.

Example (32bit):
 $ cd C:\ts3server\teamspeak3-server_win32
 $ ts3server_win32.exe
Example (64bit):
 $ cd C:\ts3server\teamspeak3-server_win64
 $ ts3server_win64.exe

2. Linux
Download the correct file for your architecture:
 - teamspeak3-server-linux_x86.tar.gz for 32bit
 - teamspeak3-server-linux_amd64.tar.gz for 64bit

Extract the archive in a directory of your choice and run the TeamSpeak 3 Server binary.

Example (Background):
$ tar xzf teamspeak3-server-linux_x86.tar.gz
$ cd teamspeak3-server-linux_x86
$ ./ts3server_startscript.sh start

ATTENTION!
In some cases, the server process terminates on startup and the error message reads “Server() error
while starting servermanager, error: instance check error”.

As long as you do not use a license key we make sure you only run exactly one instance of the TS3
server free unregistered version. We use shared memory to facilitate the communication to detect
other running instances, which requires tmpfs to be mounted at 
/dev/shm. 

If you (for whatever reason) do not have this mounted, the above error will occur. To fix this
problem, the following commands or file edits need to be done as root user (or using something like
sudo). This is a temporary fix until your next reboot. 

mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /dev/shm

Now, to make sure this mount is done automatically upon reboot edit the file /etc/fstab and add the
line:
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults 0 0

3. Mac OS X
Download the file teamspeak3-server-mac.zip, which includes an universal binary running on both
Intel 32 and 64 bit computers. Copy the archive into a directory of your choice and extract it using
Finder or the Terminal application.

$ unzip teamspeak3-server_mac.zip
$ cd teamspeak3-server_mac
$ ./ts3server_mac

-----------------------------------------------------------
3. License File
-----------------------------------------------------------

To run a TeamSpeak 3 Server instance with more than a single virtual server and 32 slots you require
a license file. The license can be obtained here: https://sales.teamspeak.com/

Without a proper license file available the server will refuse to start or fallback to limited
functionality. Once the license file is available, copy it into the TeamSpeak 3 Server directory,
where the server executable is located.

4. Server Output and Logfile

On Linux and Mac OS X the server will print its log output to the console in which you started it.
In addition the log output is written into several files, located in the logs/ subdirectory.

NOTE! 
On Windows, the server will only write the logfile, there is no console output.

-----------------------------------------------------------
5. Virtual Servers
-----------------------------------------------------------

Like with TeamSpeak 2, the server process serves as a container for multiple virtual servers running
within the same process. When the server process is started, one virtual voice server will be
automatically created unless the “create_default_virtualserver=0” commandline parameter is specified
.

The first virtual server will be running on port 9987 by default. Subsequently started virtual
servers will be running on increasing port numbers. The second on 9998, the third on 9999 etc. The
first default port can be changed by specifying the “default_voice_port=<port>” commandline
parameter.

Virtual servers are always unique, marked by an unique identifier. Hence it is not possible to start
the same virtual server within a second server process.

-----------------------------------------------------------
6. Commandline Parameters
-----------------------------------------------------------

Commandline parameters are passed to the TeamSpeak 3 Server using the form:
ts3server_<arch> <parameter1>=<value1> [<parameter2>=<value2>] ...

Important! 
All commandline parameters passed to the server need to be escaped using the ServerQuery escape
patterns (check the ServerQuery manual for details).

Example:
$ ./ts3server_minimal_runscript.sh clear_database=1 create_default_virtualserver=0

Commandline parameters are not saved over sessions, so if you passed paramaters when starting the
server process, you need to pass them again the next time. If a parameter is not specified, the
default value will be used, regardless of parameters specified during a previous server start.

The following commandline parameters are available:
-----------------------------------------------------------

• default_voice_port (9987)
  UDP port open for clients to connect to. This port is used by the first virtual server,
  subsequently started virtual servers will open on increasing port numbers.
  Default: The default voice port is 9987.

• voice_ip (0.0.0.0,0::0)
  Comma separated IP list on which the server instance will listen for incoming voice connections.
  Default: The server is bound on "any" IP address, both ipv4 and ipv6 if available.

• create_default_virtualserver (1)
  Normally one virtual server is created automatically when the TeamSpeak 3 Server process is
  started. To disable this behaviour, set this parameter to “0”. In this case you have to start
  virtual servers manually using the ServerQuery interface.
  Default: If not provided, one virtual server is created.

• machine_id (<empty>)
  Optional name of this server process to identify a group of servers with the same ID. This can be
  useful when running multiple TeamSpeak 3 Server instances on the same database. Please note that
  we strongly recommend that you do NOT run multiple server instances on the same SQLite database.
  Default: The server instance will not use a machine ID.

• filetransfer_port (30033)
  TCP Port opened for file transfers. If you specify this parameter, you also need to specify the
  “filetransfer_ip” parameter!
  Default: The default file tranfer port is 30033.

• filetransfer_ip (0.0.0.0,0::0)
  Comma separated IP list which the file transfers are bound to. If you specify this parameter, you
  also need to specify the “filetransfer_port” parameter!
  Default: File transfers are bound on "any" IP address, both ipv4 and ipv6 if available.

• query_port (10011)
  TCP Port opened for ServerQuery connections. If you specify this parameter, need to specify the
  “query_ip” parameter!
  Default: The default ServerQuery port is 10011.

• query_ip (0.0.0.0,0::0)
  Comma separated IP list on which the server instance will listen for incoming ServerQuery
  connections. If you specify this parameter, you also need to specify the “query_port” parameter!
  Default: ServerQuerys are bound on "any" IP address, both ipv4 and ipv6 if available.

• clear_database (0)
  If set to “1”, the server database will be cleared before starting up the server. This is mainly
  used for testing. Usually this parameter should not be specified, so all server settings will be
  restored when the server process is restarted.
  Default: Database is not cleared on start.

• logpath (logs/)
  The physical path where the server will create logfiles.
  Default: The server will create logfiles in the “logs/” subdirectory.

• dbplugin (ts3db_sqlite3)
  Name of the database plugin library used by the server instance. For example, if you want to start
  the server with MariaDB/MySQL support, simply set this parameter to “ts3db_mariadb” to use the
  MariaDB plugin. Do NOT specify the “lib” prefix or the file extension of the plugin.
  Default: The default SQLite3 database plugin will be used.

• dbpluginparameter (<empty>)
  A custom parameter passed to the database plugin library. For example, the MariaDB database plugin
  supports a parameter to specify the physical path of the plugins configuration file.
  Default: The database plugin will be used without a parameter.

• dbsqlpath (sql/)
  The physical path where your SQL script files are located.
  Default: The server will search for SQL script files in the “sql/” subdirectory.

• dbsqlcreatepath (create_sqlite/)
  The physical path where your SQL installation files are located. Note that this path will be added
  to the value of the “dbsqlpath” parameter. 
  Default: The server will search for SQL installation scripts files in the
  “<dbsqlpath>/dbsqlcreatepath/” subdirectory.

• licensepath (<empty>)
  The physical path where your license file is located. 
  Default: The license file is located in your servers installation directory.

• createinifile (0)
  If set to “1”, the server will create an INI-style config file containing all commandline
  parameters with the values you have specified.
  Default: The server will not create a config file. 

• inifile (<empty>)
  The physical path including the filename where your config file is located.
  Default: the config file does not exist. 

• query_ip_whitelist (query_ip_whitelist.txt)
  The file containing whitelisted IP addresses for the ServerQuery interface. All hosts listed in
  this file will be ignored by the ServerQuery flood protection.
  Default: The whitelist file is located in your servers installation directory.

• query_ip_blacklist (query_ip_blacklist.txt)
  The file containing blacklisted IP addresses for the ServerQuery interface. All hosts listed in
  this file are not allowed to connect to the ServerQuery interface.
  Default: The whitelist file is located in your servers installation directory.

• query_skipbruteforcecheck (0)
  If set to "1", the server will skip and bruteforce protection for whitelisted Ip addresses for the
  ServerQuery interface.
  Default: 0 -> bruteforce protection is enabled

• dbclientkeepdays (90)
  Defines how many days to keep unused client identities. Auto-pruning is triggered on every start
  and on every new month while the server is running.
  Default: The server will auto-prune client identities older than 90 days.

• dblogkeepdays (90)
  Defines how many days to keep database log entries. Auto-pruning is triggered on every start and
  on every new month while the server is running.
  Default: The server will auto-prune log entries older than 90 days.

• logquerycommands (1)
  If set to “1”, the server will log every ServerQuery command executed by clients. This can be
  useful while trying to diagnose several different issues.
  Default: ServerQuery commands will not be logged.

• no_permission_update (0)
  If set to “1”, new permissions will not be added to existing groups automatically. Note that this
  can break your server configuration if you do not update them manually. 
  Default: New permissions will be added to existing groups automatically.

• open_win_console (0)
  If set to “1”, the server will open a console window. Note that this only affects Windows servers.
  Default: The console will be hidden on Windows.

• no_password_dialog (0)
  If set to “1”, the server will not display the initial password dialog on the first start. Note
  that this only affects Windows servers.
  Default: The initial password dialog will be shown.

• dbconnections (10)
  The number of database connections used by the server. Please note that changing this value can
  have an affect on your servers performance. Possible values are 2-100. 
  Default: The server will use 10 database connections.

• logappend (0)
  If set to “1”, the server will not create a new logfile on every start. Instead, the log output
  will be appended to the previous logfile. The logfile name will only contain the ID of the virtual
  server.
  Default: The server will create a new logfile on every start.

-----------------------------------------------------------
7. Using Alternate Database Plugins
-----------------------------------------------------------

MariaDB plugin
To make your TeamSpeak 3 Server use a MariaDB or MySQL database you need to make sure that the
“ts3db_mariadb” library is located in your server's installation directory. Also you need the
libmariadb(.dll/.so/.dylib) library in the same directory, or in your systems search path. TeamSpeak
has provided one for you in the redist directory. You can choose to copy that one, or you can use
one that is installed on your system (Linux/FreeBSD), or you can download an official one from
MariaDB themselves here: https://downloads.mariadb.org/client-native/ . Note that the database
server version needs to be MySQL 5.5 or higher, or MariaDB 5.5 or higher. Per default, the plugin
uses the following parameters:

• host (127.0.0.1)
  The hostname or IP addresss of your MariaDB/MySQL server.

• port (3306)
  The TCP port of your MariaDB/MySQL server.

• username (root)
  The username used to authenticate with your MariaDB/MySQL server.

• password (<empty>)
  The password used to authenticate with your MariaDB/MySQL server.

• database (test)
  The name of a database on your MariaDB/MySQL server. Note that this database must be created
  before the TeamSpeak 3 Server is started. Please use 'utf8mb4' character encoding for the database
  .

• socket (<empty>)
  The name of the Unix socket file to use, for connections made via a named pipe to a local server.
  
All parameters can be customized by creating a INI-style configuration file called
“ts3db_mariadb.ini”. For example:

[config]
host=localhost
port=3306
username=teamspeak
password=x5gUjs
database=ts3db
socket=

The path and filename of the configuration file can be set using the “dbpluginparameter” commandline
parameter. To start the TeamSpeak 3 Server with MariaDB/MySQL support, you need to specify the
“dbplugin” commandline parameter. You may also need to specify the “dbsqlcreatepath” parameter if
you are starting the server instance for the first time since the syntax of the MariaDB/MySQL
installation files differs from SQLite3.

Example:
$ ./ts3server_linux_amd64 dbplugin=ts3db_mariadb dbsqlcreatepath=create_mariadb/
dbpluginparameter=ts3db_mariadb.ini

-----------------------------------------------------------
8. Gaining Adminstrator Access
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Regular clients
The first time a virtual server is created, a server administrator token will be automatically
created and written to the server log in the following format:

ServerAdmin token created, please use the line below
token=ppEa0Wp6hopKBzKhH5RiUtb5Ggve5aI8J7ifu+/P

Please note that this is an example and not a valid token on any server.

This token can be used in the TeamSpeak 3 Client to gain administrator permissions for the currently
logged in client. A token can only be used *ONCE*.

The server log is written to a file in the logs subdirectory. On Linux and Mac OS X it is also
printed to the console from which the server was started.

Important! 

2. ServerQuery clients
To gain global administration permissions for ServerQuery access, the first time the server instance
is started a ServerQuery password is printed to the console output:

Server Query Admin Acccount created
loginname= “serveradmin”, password= “BAIPwM8X”

Use the provided login name and password to access the server using the ServerQuery interface.

Note!
The ServerQuery password is only shown ONCE when the server is started for the first time, so make
sure you save this information for future reference. The only way to generate a new token and
password would be to delete the server database by starting server with the “clear_database=1”
commandline paramater or deleting the file ts3server.sqlitedb. In this case all server settings and 
user accounts would be lost.

-----------------------------------------------------------
9. Understanding the Status of a Virtual Server 
-----------------------------------------------------------

The status of a virtual server can be:

• online
  The virtual server is running and clients can connect

• offline
  The virtual server is not running

• booting up
  The virtual server is currently starting

• shutting down
  The virtual server is currently shutting down

• deploy running
  The virtual server is currently deploying a snapshot

• online virtual
  The virtual server is running *isolated* and clients cannot connect.

• other instance
  The virtual server is running in another TeamSpeak 3 instance

To select a server that is currently offline you will have to use the -virtual parameter with the
use command (e. g. use sid=1 -virtual). That will start the server in virtual mode which means you
are able to change its configuration, create channels or change permissions, but no regular
TeamSpeak 3 Client can connect. As soon as the last ServerQuery client deselects the virtual server 
(command: “use 0”) or closes connection, its status will be changed back to “offline”.

Important! 
Changing a virtual servers status from “online virtual” to “offline” is an asynchronous operation so
it is possible that a virtual server will still be in the process of shutting down when you try to
start it right after deselecting it.
